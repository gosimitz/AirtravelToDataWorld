# AirtravelToDataWorld
A simple Java program to download ontime stats from https://transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp and upload it to projects on data.world
Why? Well, I've uploaded some of the data manually, and I've found that there is some interest in it. It is a bit tedious to download the files manually, so I decided to automate it and make the data more accessible.
